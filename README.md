Due to the demands of my program at App Academy and extenuating circumstances with family, I was only able to complete the Frontend portion of this project. An example of my backend/fullstack work can be seen with this project of mine: https://github.com/akeefe09/fakegur

I hope you will consider my work in that project.

After downloading, running "npm install" and then "npm start" will allow this to run on localhost.
